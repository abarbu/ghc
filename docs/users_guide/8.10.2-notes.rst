Release notes for version 8.10.2
================================

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections.

Like previous releases in the 8.10 series, the :ghc-flag:`LLVM backend <-fllvm>`
of this release is to be used with LLVM 9.

Highlights
----------

- A few important correctness fixes for the low-latency garbage collector.
  Users of :rts-flag:`--nonmoving-gc` are strongly encouraged to upgrade
  promptly.

- Fixes a bug in process creation on Windows (:ghc-ticket:`17926`).

- Works around a Linux kernel bug in the implementation of ``timerfd``\s
  (:ghc-ticket:`18033`).

- Fixes a few specialiser regressions (:ghc-ticket:`17810`,
  :ghc-ticket:`18120`) and introduces a variety of miscellaneous
  specialiser improvements (:ghc-ticket:`16473`, :ghc-ticket:`17930`,
  :ghc-ticket:`17966`)

- Fixes a potential loss of sharing due to left operator sections
  (:ghc-ticket:`18151`).

- Fix bootstrapping of GHC with the LLVM backend on x86-64 (:ghc-ticket:`17920`).

Full details
------------

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

 - A simplifier panic manifesting when DWARF debug information is enabled has
   been fixed (:ghc-ticket:`18162`, :ghc-ticket:`17619`)


Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - The RTS now supports a flag, :rts-flag:`--copying-gc`, to counter-act the
   effect of :rts-flag:`--nonmoving-gc`.

 - The RTS now allows the user to specify a minimum time between idle GCs with
   the :rts-flag:`-Iw ⟨seconds⟩` flag. 8.10.1 contained a user's guide reference
   to this flag but did not include the associated implementation.

 - A memory leak in the cost-center profiler has been fixed
   (:ghc-ticket:`18348`)

 - A potential integer overflow in the compact normal form import logic has
   been fixed (:ghc-ticket:`16992`)

 - We now work around a Linux kernel bug in the implementation of timerfd which
   could previously result in program crashes (:ghc-ticket:`18033`)

 - The cost-center profiler's JSON output backend now escapes backslashes
   correctly (:ghc-ticket:`18438`)

 - A variety of linker issues on ARM platforms have been fixed.


``base`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix a precision issue in the implementation of ``log1mexp``
  (:ghc-ticket:`17125`)


Build system
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Fix a bug wherein GHC would link against the non-thread-safe unique supply
   implementation when bootstrapping with an unregisterised compiler
   (:ghc-ticket:`18024`)

Known issues
------------

- A long-standing bug (:ghc-ticket:`16893`) which can cause some applications
  of ``unsafeCoerce`` to segmentation fault is only partially fixed in this
  release. This release only avoids this issue in the uses of ``unsafeCoerce``
  in ``Data.Typeable.Internal``, which was the proximate cause of
  :ghc-ticket:`16893`.

  However, it is possible that this bug could manifest in user-code using
  ``unsafeCoerce`` to perform dynamic type checks. See the :ghc-ticket:`ticket
  <16893>` for details.

  We expect that this issue will be fixed in the next major release of GHC.
